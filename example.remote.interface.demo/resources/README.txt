Before running the demo, reference libraries generated by the SDK are
required. The SDK should generate:

- "core" folder, containing the API and several jar files;
- "lib" folder, containing jar files needed for building a component
- "tools" folder, containing the Ant build tool and a build script

To run the Ant build script, be sure to modify the generated 
"local.properties" files to point to your SDK.
