This folder contains all the JDO files (schemas) for the core API. JDO files are used by Data Nucleus to enhance the 
class file so it can be persisted, see http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jpa/enhancer.html. The directory
structure matches that of the source code and included in the bundle so that the JDO files are in the same folder as the
matching class file.
