    <!-- GlassFish default encoding is ISO-8859, but because we are using JSF and Servlets the encoding is actually UTF-8.
         This causes the warning: "Unable to set request character encoding to UTF-8 from context /, because request 
         parameters have already been read, or ServletRequest.getReader() has already been called." To avoid this we set the 
         default encoding for GlassFish to UTF-8 by doing the following below. -->
