# DESCRIPTION:
# Contains default properties for the Ant build of the entire controller.  The 
# build.properties file should be used to override these settings.  Do not 
# change this file unless intending to commit it. 
#
# NOTE: <property environment="env" /> must be in the build file before this 
# property file is included. Also, properties contained in 
# cnf/ant/default.properties should not be declared here.
# This file will be loaded after the cnf/ant/default.properties file and therefore
# properties declared here that are already declared in the cnf/ant/default.properties
# will not be set.
