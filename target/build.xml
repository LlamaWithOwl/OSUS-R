    <!-- 
        This target will call on each target environment to build all applications, but only the pieces that are unique
        to the target (why it is called build-no-deps).  Therefore, for this build target to actually work, the build 
        files must be run in a certain order as windows/linux depend on generic and the others depend on linux.  Other 
        targets in this file have no dependencies so the subant task can be used to gather the build files.
